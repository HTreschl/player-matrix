This repo contains the code for this webapp https://roster-tech.streamlit.app/

The app allows users to upload player projections data and run game sims for NFL daily fantasy games. It includes an optimizer, slate simulations, player correlations, and a tool dive into optimal player pairings.

This tool includes an adaptation of my DFS optimizer, available here: https://github.com/HTreschl/DFS-Optimizer-With-Sims
